            Welcome to my professional portfolio. I'm K. Adil Rahman, a Data Science enthusiast with a Masterâ€™s in Advanced Computer Science from the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK. My journey is a testament to my dedication to using data and technology to solve real-world problems.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            My academic path emphasized data science and computer vision, with projects from predictive modeling to real-time facial recognition using CNNs. These experiences honed my technical skills and fostered a spirit of collaboration and innovation.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Transitioning from academia to industry, my internship as a React.js Developer at AK Technology was a significant milestone, enhancing my development skills and understanding of team dynamics.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            My diverse skill set includes SQL, Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, React.js, and AWS. This toolkit ensures I am well-versed in the development and deployment of scalable solutions.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            My commitment to excellence was recognized when I led a project to victory in an Application Development competition, underlining my capability in delivering impactful technology solutions.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Driven by the belief that thoughtful technology can enhance our understanding and improve lives, my goal is to explore the depths of data science and machine learning, contributing to boundary-pushing projects.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            I invite you to explore my portfolio and join me on this exciting journey in data science and technology.
